# XPS Tracker Updater Releases

This repository hosts official release packages and the automatic-update manifest for XPS Tracker Updater.

The updater checks `update_manifest.json` over HTTPS, downloads a newer ZIP only after user approval, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, backs up the installed program files, installs the update after the application closes, and restores the prior version if installation fails.

No master spreadsheets, scanned PDFs, trouble tickets, OCR caches, logs, or company data are stored here.
